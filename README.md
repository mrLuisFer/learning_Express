# Hello World!ðŸ‘‹

## AboutðŸ“š

In this repository I will show doing a little practice, while learning the use of the Express.js framework, which is a framework for node.js

It serves to be able to make applications with node in a simpler way and to have all the methods that node brings as well as the Http modules, connections to Databases, etc.

## Why this repository?

Why is to have a place to use as a reference when creating larger projects

And also where to have the code of practices that I am doing while I learn Express, while I practice node.js
